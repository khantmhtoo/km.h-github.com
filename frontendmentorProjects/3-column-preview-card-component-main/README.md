## My process

- Began with mobile layout and transition into desktop layout
- Create a container and centerize the whole container
- Create multiple divs for each car content and some html which represents inner content
- Style the html

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Somethings I learn are that I need to redo some of these design and responsive layout changes depending on the zoom value of the window.

```css
media query section is something I believe was the key strength in this project
```
